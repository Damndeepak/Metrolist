     *     Korean, or when two providers agree on it. A lone Chinese result for a song with a Latin
     *     title is far more often a mismatched search hit than the original, and it used to win
     *     outright, which is how English and Indonesian songs ended up showing Chinese lyrics.

     * Then, among lyrics in the right language, sync quality (word > line > plain), then duet
     * tags, then provider order.

/**
 * Lyrics auto offset: listens to the song, finds where it's being sung, and moves the lyrics so
 * each line lands on its singing (see [VocalActivityAnalyzer] and [LyricsAligner]). Only for
 * lyrics timed by line or by word; plain text has no timing to move.
 *
 * It runs here, in the music service, rather than in the sheet that asked: the service's data
 * source is the one that can read any song (streamed, cached, downloaded or on the phone), and a
 * sync that's under way still finishes and saves when the sheet is closed.

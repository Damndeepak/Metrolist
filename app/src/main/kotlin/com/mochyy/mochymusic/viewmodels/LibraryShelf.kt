// LibraryShelf.kt
//
// The Library's Local and Cached tabs each show one slice of the library, picked out by its songs.
// The liked songs, albums, artists and playlists on those tabs are all worked out from the songs,
// the same way for both, so the two tabs and the pages they open always count alike.
